Sameer used import math to use multiple math functions, but Dayanidhi only needed pi, so he wrote from math import pi.\n","\n","--->> So the main difference is: import brings the whole toolbox, but from ... import picks only the tool we need."],"metadata":{"id":"kV7n4zeXfSP6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question:7-->How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n","\n","Answer:7:-->>\n","\n","---> In Python, we can handle multiple exceptions by writing separate except blocks for each type of error.\n","\n","---> This helps us give different messages or actions depending on what kind of problem happened.\n","\n","--->>> We can also handle many exceptions in one line using a tuple if we want to treat them the same way.\n","\n","--> For example, Sameer was building a form where users enter their age and name.

All the threads share the same memory space, so they can talk to each other easily. It’s mostly used when the task involves waiting—like reading files, downloading stuff, or handling inputs. It uses less memory and is faster to switch between tasks.\n","\n","---> Multiprocessing, on the other hand, is when we run multiple processes at the same time. Each process has its own memory, so they don’t affect each other. This is useful for heavy CPU tasks like data crunching, machine learning, or video processing. It's more powerful but also takes more memory.\n","\n","--->>> So, if we’re doing small background tasks together, multithreading is better. But for big, separate tasks that need full power, multiprocessing works best.\n","\n","--> We used multithreading for a chatbot project where the bot listened and replied at the same time. Later, we used multiprocessing in another project where multiple data files were being processed together."],"metadata":{"id":"C4v_s975g6xK"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question:10:-->> What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n","\n","Answer 10--->>\n","\n","---> Logging helps us keep a record of what our program is doing while it runs, which makes it easier to track problems.\n","\n","---> It also helps when we want to check how our program behaved in the past without printing everything on the screen.\n","\n","--->>> Logging gives us levels like info, warning, error, and debug—so we can organize messages properly and only see what we need.\n","\n","--> For example, when we were testing a web app, instead of printing each step, we used logging to save all activities in a log file. Later we just opened that file to check what went wrong.\n","\n","--->> So logging saves time, helps in debugging, and gives us a clean way to understand the flow of our program."],"metadata":{"id":"PKDnk298iJub"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question :11:-->>What is memory management in Python?\n","\n","Answer:11-->>\n","\n","---> Memory management in Python means how Python handles and organizes memory for storing data while the program runs.\n","\n","---> It takes care of assigning memory to variables, objects, and also cleaning up memory that is no longer needed.\n","\n","--->>> Python uses something called garbage collection, which automatically removes objects from memory if they are not being used anymore.\n","\n","--> For example, when we create a list and later delete it or stop using it, Python clears that memory in the background so we don’t have to do it ourselves.\n","\n","--->> So, memory management in Python helps our programs run smoothly without wasting memory or crashing due to memory issues."],"metadata":{"id":"hGdEs_Buigo1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question:12:-->>What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n","\n","Answer:12:--->>\n","\n","-> First, we write the risky code (the code that might cause an error) inside a try block.\n","\n","---> Then, we write one or more except blocks to catch and handle specific errors if they happen.\n","\n","--->>> We can also use an else block if we want to run some code only when there is no error.\n","\n","--> After that, we can add a finally block which will always run, no matter if there was an error or not.\n","\n","--->> So basically, the steps are:\n","\n","1.Write the code in try\n","\n","2.Handle errors in except\n","\n","3.Optional work in else\n","\n","4.Cleanup work in finally"],"metadata":{"id":"3U5JHQqVizVX"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question:13:-->Why is memory management important in Python?\n","\n","Answer:13-->\n","\n","---> Memory management is important in Python because it makes sure our program uses memory properly without wasting it.\n","\n","---> If memory is not managed well, the program can slow down, crash, or freeze—especially when we deal with large data or long-running tasks.\n","\n","--->>> Python uses automatic memory management with a garbage collector, which removes unused objects and keeps memory clean.\n","\n","--> For example, when we work on a data analysis project with lots of files, memory can fill up quickly.

It helps us handle the problem without crashing the program.\n","\n","--->>> We can also catch specific types of errors using different except blocks for better control.\n","\n","--> For example, we were making a program that asks users to enter a number. If someone typed letters by mistake, the try block gave an error, but the except block showed a friendly message like “Please enter a valid number.”\n","\n","--->> So, try and except work together to stop the program from breaking and let us deal with problems in a smart way."],"metadata":{"id":"QouF--aqjnJD"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question:15-->>>How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n","\n","Answer:15-->\n","\n","--> Python's garbage collection system automatically removes objects from memory that are no longer being used.\n","\n","---> It helps free up space so that the program doesn't waste memory or slow down over time.\n","\n","--->>> Python mainly uses a technique called reference counting—every object keeps track of how many times it’s being used. When that count becomes zero, it means no one needs it, so it gets deleted.\n","\n","--> On top of that, Python also has a cyclic garbage collector to handle special cases where two objects refer to each other but are not used anywhere else.\n","\n","--->> So, we don’t have to delete things manually—Python’s garbage collector keeps cleaning things behind the scenes to make our program run smoothly."],"metadata":{"id":"GE79qPhqj6kY"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question:16:--->>What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n","\n","Answer:16:--->\n","\n","---> The else block in exception handling is used to write code that should run only if no error happens in the try block.\n","\n","---> It helps us separate the normal code from the error-handling code, which makes the program easier to read and understand.\n","\n","--->>> The else block comes right after all the except blocks, and it won’t run if any exception occurs.\n","\n","--> For example, we wrote a program to divide two numbers. Inside try, we did the division. If there was no error, the else block printed the result.

It’s mainly used in Unix or Linux systems.\n","\n","---> This method gives us two processes—parent and child—and they start running separately from that point.\n","\n","--->>> On the other hand, multiprocessing is a high-level module provided by Python. It gives us an easier and more cross-platform way to create and manage processes.\n","\n","--> For example, we used multiprocessing.Process to run two functions at the same time on Windows.
